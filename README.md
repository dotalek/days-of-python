# 100 Days of Python
This is a repository for documenting my Python learning process, progress and portfolio. It mainly focuses in the 100 days of code challenge as modeled by Dr. Angela Yu's course in Udemy [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

Additionally, various other sources and books have inspired me to learn additional concepts, and write other programs whilst working to complete the daily challenges. Said programs will be included in the folder corresponding to the respective day I worked on it.
